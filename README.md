Homology-Batch-Processor
========================

Several SVL scripts written for the commercial <a href = "https://www.chemcomp.com/MOE-Molecular_Operating_Environment.htm">Molecular Operating Environment</a> application to automate batch homology modeling jobs.

How to use:
 - Load "HomologyBatch.svl" into MOE, with the only argument being the location of at least one '.pdb' protein file to act as a template with which to compare mutant strains to, and at least one '.fst' sequence file containing the mutant strains.
 - If running the script for the first time, you will be prompted to select appropriate homology modeling options.
